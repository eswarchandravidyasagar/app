<!doctype html><html lang="en"><head>Notice the use of /eswarchandravidyasagar/app in the tags above. It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build. Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML. Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "/eswarchandravidyasagar/app/favicon.ico" will work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL. Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`. --><title>React App</title><script defer="defer" src="/eswarchandravidyasagar/app/static/js/main.e6ac9ba2.js"></script><link href="/eswarchandravidyasagar/app/static/css/main.073c9b0a.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
